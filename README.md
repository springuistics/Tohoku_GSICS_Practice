# Tohoku_GSICS_Practice
A practice project so that we can learn some python together

Hello everyone, please join and then write your name below:

Ryan Spring



Your homework:

#1  Get the "Git CMD" program from     https://git-scm.com/downloads

#2  Go to my repository called "EventConflationFinder"
-> Open file "English_ECFinder.py"
-> Look at line 26  for "how to import the filedialog box"
-> Look at lines 39-41 for "how to use the filedialog box"
-> Make a new button for getting the filename
-> See if you can figure out in OUR practice program how to change the button to open a filedialog box for the user
-> The old button should start the program
-> Of course any other fun changes (colors, etc.) are welcome!

#3  Change YOUR github file (with your name) to your new code


Next time:
I will introduce the REAL problem that WE are going to fix!!!
